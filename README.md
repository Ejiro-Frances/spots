## 🔍 Project Overview

This project was initially assigned to Althschool Frontend Tinuyka students by [Mr. Oluwasetemi Ojo](https://github.com/Oluwasetemi) as a group project.

After building together as a group, we were asked to individually convert it to a React project.

> **First challenge**: Create a **profile page** with a photo grid, and minimal interactions like edit profile and make new post which reflects in the photo grid section, also make the images previewable in a modal and do this collaboratively as a group.

**Next Challenge**: Convert the project to a React app
